# Transform a html form into a calculator


Hi ðŸ‘‹

This Js script is made to transform a html form into a dynamic calculator on your Homepage/landing page. 
I made it as easy to use as possible.

All you have to do is copy & past this code before your /body tag and change the parameters to fit with your html code.

I've made two different versions for two different use

## Live Calculator

This calculator is for casual use. Someone comes on your website, set different values (size, material, location, whatever) in your form and the result change dynamically. On this one you want to avoid the form to be submited so it can stay on the page.

The result as to be displayed on a text element, so create a text element with ID = 'Result'.



## Lead Gen Calculator

This one is a bit different. You want your prospect to complet the form and get the result by email (so you get their email, and can start to annoy them).

Here you want the form to be submited, so you need to create a form field (which will be on display : None) to store your result and set to it ID = 'Result'.

That's it.
